"""Cross-tenant isolation hardening tests (H-3 + H-4).

H-3: Mock embeddings were a pure function of text. Two tenants indexing
the same patent got byte-identical vectors. A similarity-oracle attack
against /v1/retrieve_prior_art could confirm whether a given patent
was in some tenant's index. Fix: salt the mock SHA-256 with tenant_id.

H-4: Per-tenant audit verify is blind to a fabricated row whose
tenant_id is one the auditor doesn't think to query (typo, ghost
tenant). Fix: ``verify_global_chain()`` walks every tenant + asserts
each tenant_id is in DEMO_TENANTS + every prev_row_hash references a
real row.

These tests are the load-bearing assertions that close H-3 and H-4.
