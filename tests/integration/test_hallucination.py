"""Q14 end-to-end hallucination defence — the "career-ending fabricated
citation" scenario.

The story: an LLM drafts a polished response to an Office Action and, buried in
otherwise-correct prose, fabricates authority — a made-up Federal Reporter case
("Smith v. Jones, 999 F.3d 1234"), a reference to a grounded slot that was never
retrieved ("[GROUNDED_REF_99]"), and a prior-art patent number that nobody put
in front of the model ("US0000000"). An attorney who files that response has
cited non-existent law to a tribunal. That is the failure mode Q14 exists to
prevent.

`oa_analyzer.verify_citations` is the hard wall (CLAUDE.md §4 #5): it runs regex
extraction + grounded-set enforcement FIRST (strips anything not grounded and not
a whitelisted statute), then a second-stage verifier LLM as an independent check
(CLAUDE.md §9 "Don't skip the verifier"). This test drives the real function
end-to-end (mock backends) and asserts every fabrication is caught while the one
legitimately grounded citation survives untouched.
