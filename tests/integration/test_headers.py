"""Integration tests for Security Chunk C — M-1 security response headers.

The gateway adds six baseline browser-defence headers on every response.
This module verifies each one is present, has the expected literal value
(where appropriate), and persists across success + error response paths.

Headers under test:
  * Strict-Transport-Security — HSTS, forces https on subsequent visits.
  * Content-Security-Policy   — declarative XSS / data-exfil bound.
  * X-Frame-Options           — clickjacking deny (paired with frame-ancestors).
  * X-Content-Type-Options    — refuse MIME sniffing.
  * Referrer-Policy           — bounds Referer leak on cross-origin nav.
  * Permissions-Policy        — disables sensor / payment APIs.

If a future refactor breaks one of these (e.g. someone removes the
middleware to "simplify") this module goes red. The header values
themselves are owned by ``backend/gateway/main.py`` constants — these
tests assert on the visible HTTP wire.
