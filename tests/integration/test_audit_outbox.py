"""Integration tests for the durable audit outbox (Q13 — invariant #4 backstop).

Invariant #4 (CLAUDE.md §4) promises *exactly one* audit row per gateway
request — even on errors. ``_safe_audit_write`` deliberately swallows any
exception from the primary SQLite audit writer so a broken audit DB can't mask
the genuine response the caller is about to see. Pre-outbox, that swallow lost
the row forever → zero rows → invariant #4 silently violated.

The outbox (``backend.gateway.audit_outbox``) closes the hole: on primary-write
failure the full payload is appended (fsync'd) to a durable JSONL file, and a
``replay_outbox()`` job drains it back into the audit DB once the DB recovers.

These tests cover:
  1. Writer failure → request still returns its normal response (no 500 leaks
     from audit) AND a row lands in the outbox file, JSON-parseable, carrying
     the expected endpoint/case_id.
  2. ``replay_outbox()`` drains the outbox into the real audit DB once writes
     succeed again, leaving ``outbox_depth() == 0`` and the replayed row
     visible to the auditor.
  3. ``replay_outbox`` / ``outbox_depth`` tolerate a missing/empty file.

The audit failure is simulated exactly as ``test_audit_error_path.py`` does:
monkeypatch ``backend.gateway.audit.writer.write`` to raise. The outbox path is
pinned to a per-test ``tmp_path`` via ``config.AUDIT_OUTBOX_PATH`` so the real
``data/`` tree is never touched and tests don't see each other's backlog.
