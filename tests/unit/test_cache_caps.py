"""Per-tenant cache cap + redaction-version invalidation tests (M-7 + M-8).

Pre-fix the in-memory cache was an unbounded dict per tenant. One noisy
tenant could fill RAM with a million response entries; the cap was
nominally enforced by Redis's allkeys-lru but no equivalent existed for
the in-memory backend (which is what the smoke tests + pytest use).

Post-fix:
  * ``_MemoryCache`` tracks insertion order per tenant in an OrderedDict.
  * When ``MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES_PER_TENANT`` is hit, the oldest entry is
    evicted (FIFO). Eviction is per-tenant — tenant_b's quiet keys are
    NOT touched when tenant_a goes over cap.
  * ``hash_prompt`` now folds ``REDACTION_VERSION`` into the hash so a
    redaction ruleset change invalidates pre-change cached responses.

These tests are the load-bearing assertions that close M-7 + M-8.
