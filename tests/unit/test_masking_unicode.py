"""Unicode normalisation tests for `backend.gateway.masking.redact` (M-6 fix).

Pre-fix the regex inventory matched only ASCII codepoints, so a user
pasting fullwidth digits (``０９１２`` U+FF10..FF19) or a decomposed
email (``a\\u0301lice@…``) bypassed redaction entirely — the masked text
sent to the LLM still contained the raw PII.

Post-fix ``redact`` runs ``unicodedata.normalize("NFKC", text)`` before
applying any regex. NFKC was chosen over NFC because the threat model
includes fullwidth + ligature variants (auto-corrected Word docs are a
real source of fullwidth digits in Taiwan office actions) — NFC alone
only handles combining diacritics.

These tests are the load-bearing assertions that close M-6. Removing
the NFKC normalisation must turn every one of them red.
