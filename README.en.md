PatentMind semi-automates the drafting of patent OA responses **without ever
letting client data leak to a public LLM** — and makes every AI claim
verifiable, every action auditable, and the attorney accountable for the final
draft. The interesting part for most people isn't the patent workflow; it's the
**security/trust gateway pattern** underneath it, which applies to any
AI feature handling confidential, compliance-sensitive data.

---

## Why it exists

Law firms answering a patent Office Action today, by hand:

- **Slow** — reading the OA, finding prior art, and writing the response is
  mostly manual (effort varies widely by firm; no reliable public figure).
- **Hallucination risk** — citing the wrong statute or a fabricated case is a
  professional-liability event.
- **Deadline risk** — miscalculating the statutory deadline can forfeit the
  patent. There is no undo.
- **Confidentiality** — client matter data must never go to a public LLM, which
  is exactly why firms can't just paste it into ChatGPT.

PatentMind addresses all four — and the attorney still signs off on every
sentence.

## What makes it different (the trust layer)

These are enforced **invariants**, not features you can toggle off
(see [`CLAUDE.md` §4](CLAUDE.md)):

| Guarantee | How |
|---|---|
| 🛡️ **No data leak** | Mandatory PII/customer redaction before *any* LLM call; reversal map stays on-prem |
| 🏠 **Confidential → local** | Confidential cases auto-route to an on-prem LLM, never the cloud |
| 🎯 **No hallucinated citations** | Two-stage generate→verify; citations not in the grounded set are stripped, and the UI shows *what* was stripped + which model verified |
| 🧾 **Tamper-evident audit** | Every request writes exactly one append-only, hash-chained audit row — user-verifiable, not vendor-attested |
| 👤 **Per-case access control** | `case_id` ACL checked on every request; multi-tenant isolation |
| ✍️ **Human accountability** | Sentence-level provenance (AI / paralegal / attorney) + a hard attorney sign-off gate before export |

A general-purpose chatbot can't offer the first five. That's the moat.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: **Python 3.13** (3.14 not yet supported — no paddle / pinned-dep wheels), **Node 24**. Runs fully in **mock mode** — no
API keys required.

```bash
# One-click (backend + frontend + seed + auto-generated secrets)
bash scripts/start_demo.sh

# …or piece by piece:
# Backend (full POC) — gateway :8010 + ai_engine :8011, seeds demo data
bash scripts/start_backend.sh
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173

# End-to-end verification — must print "ALL CHECKS PASSED"
bash scripts/verify.sh

# Full delivery stack (Docker infra + digiRunner/Dify probes, LLM_MODE=dify capable)
bash scripts/start_delivery.sh
```

Demo login passwords are `demo-<user>` (e.g. `demo-alice`); see `.env.example`.

## Try it (decision → demo)

| Try | Action | What to watch |
|---|---|---|
| Case ACL (Q12) | Log in as Carol → analyze `CASE-2025-001` | 403 — Carol isn't on that case |
| Redaction (Q10) | Alice → "Preview redaction" | email / phone / case-no replaced with placeholders |
| Grounded cites (Q14) | Run analysis → open a `[GROUNDED_REF_1]` pill | shows source patent + section + text; unverified cites shown as removed |
| Sign-off (Q16) | Accept/Edit each sentence in the draft | purple = AI, green = attorney; export gated until all signed |
| Audit (Q13) | Log in as Dave → Audit page | mask-rule log + green "verify hash chain" |
| Confidential routing (Q15) | Re-run with a `-CONF` case_id | audit row's model flips to the local model |
| Cache (Q9) | Analyze the same OA + case twice | 2nd audit row: model=`cache`, tokens=0 |
| Deadline (Q17) | See the deadline → click "Why" | weekend/holiday roll-forward, with the calculation basis |

**Real digiRunner + Dify integration** (delivered 2026-06-11): the stack runs
behind [digiRunner OSS](https://github.com/TPIsoftware/digirunner-open-source)
with auto-registered routes (`bash scripts/start_digirunner.sh`), and AI
inference flows through a self-hosted Dify CE workflow on local Ollama
(`python scripts/setup_dify.py`, then `LLM_MODE=dify`). The citation verifier
(Q14) stays in our code as the un-bypassable hard wall. See
[`docs/DELIVERY_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/DELIVERY_RUNBOOK.md).

Two rules keep the security boundary clean: **the gateway never calls an LLM
directly**, and **the AI engine holds no business state**. Full decision→code
map in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Tech stack

FastAPI · React 19 + Vite 8 · TanStack Query · Tailwind 4 · React Router 7 ·
react-i18next (zh-TW/EN) · Playwright + vitest + pytest. Cloud LLM: Claude Sonnet 5
(reasoning) + Claude Haiku 4.5 (verifier) via `anthropic` 1.8.0; local LLM: Ollama
`qwen2.5:7b`. Vector store / cache / LLM are abstracted so mock ↔
production swaps by env (`LLM_MODE`, `VECTOR_BACKEND`, `CACHE_BACKEND`).

## Documentation

- [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) — the 20 architectural decisions (read first)
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — each decision → which code, and why
- [`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`](docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md) — security self-audit
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — agent/maintainer handoff + hardening TODO list

## Demo accounts

| User | Role | Tenant | Cases | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `alice` | attorney | tenant_a | CASE-2025-001..003 | analyze, sign off |
| `bob` | paralegal | tenant_a | CASE-2025-001..002 | analyze, assist drafting |
| `carol` | it_admin | tenant_b | (none) | dashboard, quota |
| `audit_dave` | auditor | tenant_a | * | audit, verify chain |

## Status

This is a **proof of concept**. It is **not safe to expose beyond localhost**
without the hardening in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)
§3/§5. Most of the original stubs are now implemented behind env knobs:
real LLM backends (`LLM_MODE=anthropic | local | dify`), Qdrant
(`VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant`), Redis cache/rate-limit/revocation
(`CACHE_BACKEND=redis` etc.), OIDC/SAML/magic-link endpoints (stub IdP),
local WORM audit archiver, Prometheus `/metrics`, backup + DR drill, and a
holiday-calendar fetcher. The 2026-09-25 review branch adds a fail-closed
case registry (`data/case_registry.json` — unregistered cases are treated as
confidential and stay on the local model), HMAC-keyed audit rows over every
field (`AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`), NER masking, per-subject erasure, emailed magic
links, token-protected `/metrics`, Qdrant 1.19 hybrid retrieval with optional
Qwen3 embedding/reranker, PaddleOCR-VL, and service-date / per-applicant
deadline rules (not reviewed by a patent attorney). Still stubbed: vision
figure Q&A, a production SAML IdP, and streaming replication. Test baseline
(2026-09-25, no docker services): **pytest 1615 passed / 48 skipped**,
**vitest 58 passed**, **Playwright 92 passed**; the full live chain
(SPA :5173 → digiRunner :18080 → gateway :8010 → ai_engine :8011 →
Dify :8088 → Ollama qwen2.5:7b) completes an analyze in **~25–28 s**.
