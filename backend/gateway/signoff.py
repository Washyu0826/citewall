"""Q16 — human-in-the-loop sign-off helpers (responsibility boundary).

The Q16 decision (docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/QUESTIONS.md §Q16) requires more
than a lone ``DraftResponse.requires_attorney_review`` boolean. It requires:

  * a real RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY — the system records which sentences are
    AI-generated, which the attorney rewrote, and which the attorney added;
  * a HARD EXPORT GATE — the attorney must tick "我已逐項確認" (a checkbox
    mapped to ``ExportRequest.attorney_signoff``) before any document is
    produced. Not ticked → no document.

This module holds the pure (no-FastAPI, no-DB) building blocks the
``/v1/oa/export`` handler in ``main.py`` composes:

  * ``assemble_document``  — concatenate the ACCEPTED segments in order.
  * ``summarise_provenance`` — count segments by source (the responsibility
    boundary, distilled to integers for the audit row).
  * ``content_hash``       — SHA-256 of the assembled document, so the audit
    row can prove WHICH document was signed off WITHOUT storing the raw text
    (CLAUDE.md §9: don't put raw draft text in the hash-chained log).

Keeping these here (rather than inline in the handler) makes them unit-testable
and keeps the handler focused on the policy gates (auth, role, ACL, signoff).
