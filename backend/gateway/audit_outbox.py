"""Durable write-ahead outbox for audit rows (Q13 — invariant #4 backstop).

Invariant #4 (CLAUDE.md §4) says *every* gateway request writes exactly one
audit row — even errors. The gateway enforces the "always attempt a write"
half with a try/finally in each handler. But the primary audit store (SQLite
file or Postgres — ``AUDIT_BACKEND``) can still fail a write at runtime: disk
full, file locked by a concurrent backup, a dropped Postgres connection, or
the append-only trigger refusing the INSERT. When that happens,
``_safe_audit_write`` (main.py) must NOT re-raise —
re-raising would mask the genuine response/error the caller is about to see.
Pre-outbox the swallowed failure meant the audit row was lost *forever*, which
silently breaks invariant #4: the contract claims "exactly one row even on
errors" but a write failure leaves zero rows. For a legal-compliance audit log
that is a contract-termination-level defect.

This module closes that hole with an outbox / write-ahead pattern:

  * On primary-write failure the caller hands the *full* audit payload to
    :func:`enqueue` here, which appends one JSON line to a flat file
    (``AUDIT_OUTBOX_PATH``) and ``fsync``s it. Appending to a schema-less,
    trigger-less, lock-free flat file is far more robust than the SQLite write
    that just failed — it is the most durable thing we can still do when the
    primary store is unhappy.
  * :func:`replay_outbox` re-attempts each queued row against the real audit
    writer once the DB recovers, then rewrites the file with only the rows
    that still failed (or truncates it when all succeeded).
  * :func:`outbox_depth` reports the pending backlog as an ops/health signal.

The enqueued record stores the *primitive* identity fields (user_id,
tenant_id, role, display_name) rather than the live :class:`User` Pydantic
object, so the record is JSON-serialisable and survives a process restart.
``replay_outbox`` reconstructs a :class:`User` from those fields before calling
``audit.writer.write``.

    does) so any stray non-JSON-native value (e.g. a datetime in a payload)

    fidelity here; the worst case is a slightly stringified field, never a
    lost row.

    This function never raises to the caller: if even the flat-file append
    fails (the truly catastrophic case — disk genuinely full), we log at
