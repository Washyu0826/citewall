"""Gateway auth (Q12).

Three IdP modes are supported in production: built-in / OIDC SAML / magic link.
POC simplifies to JWT — built-in login (`/v1/auth/login`) and the magic-link
flow (`issue_magic_token` / `consume_magic_token`, wired to
`/v1/auth/magic/request` + `/v1/auth/magic/consume`) are implemented here;
OIDC/SAML remain TODO. The **case_id check** is the part that matters
most and that we keep verbatim:

    Every API call must carry case_id.
    The user must have access to that case.
    This avoids conflict-of-interest 看錯案件.

This is a real legal compliance requirement, not generic auth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compat Refactor 3 — digiRunner-style upstream-trust auth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Production deployment places digiRunner in front of this gateway:

    client -> digiRunner (OIDC / SAML / OAuth validation) -> gateway

digiRunner validates the IdP exchange at its own layer, then forwards the
validated identity to us via headers:

    x-user-id      validated user id (required for upstream path)
    x-tenant-id    validated tenant id (required for upstream path)
    x-user-role    optional UserRole.value (defaults to PARALEGAL — least
                   privilege — when missing or unrecognised)

Security model: these headers are HONOURED ONLY when the immediate TCP peer
(`request.client.host`) is in `settings.TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_IPS`. Any request
from outside that list is forced down the JWT path even if it includes
spoofed `x-user-id` headers — so the only attacker who can fake an identity
is one already inside the trusted network segment (and at that point they
own the box anyway).

We deliberately consult `request.client.host` rather than
`X-Forwarded-For`: the latter is itself a header and is therefore spoofable
by the very same attacker we are trying to block. `request.client.host` is
the kernel-observed peer address, which the attacker cannot forge from off
the wire. The trade-off is that this assumes digiRunner is the immediate
upstream — if a second proxy is inserted between digiRunner and us, the
deployment must either (a) terminate that proxy on the trusted-IP list or
(b) swap to a verified-X-Forwarded-For scheme.

The JWT path remains as a fallback for two scenarios:
  1. Local development (no digiRunner running — `python -m uvicorn ...`).
  2. The /v1/auth/login demo flow used during prospect demos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Role-assertion whitelist (Compat Refactor 3 follow-up)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The upstream may freely assert ATTORNEY or PARALEGAL on an unknown user
(those are the everyday roles digiRunner's IdP will surface). It may NOT
assert AUDITOR or IT_ADMIN on an unknown user_id — those privileged roles
must come from the local ``_USERS`` table (server-controlled). Without
this restriction, anyone with a foothold on a trusted IP could claim
auditor by setting a single header and read the entire append-only audit
log of every tenant.

For known users (those listed in ``_USERS``), the local table wins
unconditionally — the upstream role header is ignored. This means alice
is always an attorney even if digiRunner forgets to set the header (or a
bug there sets it to ``it_admin``).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synthetic user_id quota DoS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The upstream can mint arbitrary user_ids on the fly (e.g. an attacker on
the trusted segment iterating user-N for large N). Each synthetic user
gets a fresh ``daily_token_quota`` bucket in rate_limit.py, which a naive
caller might exploit to bypass the per-user cap.

This is bounded by the per-tenant monthly cap (``TENANT_MONTHLY_TOKENS``),
which is checked on the same path before any LLM call. The tenant-level
cap is the real safety net here — per-user quotas are a UX nicety, not a
security boundary against an attacker already inside a trusted IP. If
that threat model expands, the right fix is to require a signed claim
(JWT in ``x-upstream-auth-token``) rather than to inflate the user-quota
machinery.

# Q12 — Magic-link auth flow (fills the named `/auth/magic` stub).
#
# The small-firm path: a <10-person practice with no IdP and no appetite for
# password management. The user asks for a link, clicks it, and is logged in.
#
# Token scheme: we reuse the existing JWT machinery (same HS256 signature with
# `settings.JWT_SECRET`) so the token is tamper-evident and self-expiring with
# zero extra crypto. A magic token is distinguished from a session token by a
# `typ: "magic"` claim — `verify_token` only accepts session tokens (no `typ`
# claim or `typ != "magic"`), and `consume_magic_token` only accepts magic
# tokens, so a magic token can NEVER be presented as a Bearer session token and
# vice-versa. Each magic token carries a unique `jti`; once consumed that `jti`
# is recorded so a replay (clicking the same link twice, or an attacker who
# captured it from a log) is rejected.

# Agent F — enterprise IdP: OIDC authorization-code + SAML ACS (Q12, Day 13F)
# ===========================================================================
#
# The named stubs (`/v1/auth/oidc/callback`, `/v1/auth/saml/acs`) are fleshed
# out here into testable, MOCKABLE paths. Two design rules keep the suite
# offline AND the security real:
#
#   1. The identity provider is dependency-injected behind a small protocol
#      (``OIDCProvider`` / ``SAMLProvider``). Tests inject a stub that validates
#      a SIGNED assertion (HMAC) — the same control-flow a real provider runs,
#      minus the network call to Keycloak/Okta/ADFS and the JWKS/XML-DSig
#      crypto. Production sets ``OIDC_PROVIDER=authlib`` / ``SAML_PROVIDER=
#      python3-saml`` and the callback handlers are UNCHANGED — they only ever
#      see a validated ``IdpIdentity``.
#
#   2. The CSRF (state/nonce) + replay guards live in THIS module, provider-
#      agnostic, so they protect every backend. A real IdP integration cannot
#      forget them.
#
# What's still a stub (documented for the next contributor):
#   * OIDC stub HMAC-signs the "authorization code" instead of doing a real
#     code->token exchange + ID-token JWKS signature verification.
#   * SAML stub HMAC-signs the assertion blob instead of verifying XML-DSig.
#   Both are the ONLY shortcuts; state/nonce/replay/audience/expiry are real.

    1. **Wraps auth_dependency** — the returned dependency depends on
       ``auth_dependency`` via FastAPI's ``Depends`` mechanism, so role
       checks always run AFTER authentication has succeeded. FastAPI
       caches dependency results per-request, so if an endpoint also wires
       ``Depends(auth_dependency)`` directly the inner call is reused (no
       double JWT decode, no double ACL check).

    2. **403 (not 401)** on role mismatch — the user is authenticated,
       they just lack permission. Status code consistency with the rest
       of the gateway's role gates (e.g. `_AUDIT_APPEND_ROLES` returns 403,
       /v1/audit/recent returns 403, etc.).

    3. **Error message names the user's role + lists allowed roles** —
       gives the operator a clear "who has access" signal without leaking
       case data. The role enum values are public information (they appear
       in the JWT payload).
