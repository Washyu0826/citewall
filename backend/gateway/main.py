# Security Chunk C — M-1. Security headers middleware.
#
# Adds the six baseline response headers every browser-facing service should
# ship with. Applied via `@app.middleware("http")` so they fire on EVERY
# response — including 4xx error responses (clickjacking via a 404 page is
# still clickjacking) and CORS preflight OPTIONS responses.
#
# CSP rationale:
#   * `default-src 'self'`   — refuses arbitrary third-party loads.
#   * `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` — vite injects inline scripts in
#     dev for HMR + chunk preloads. Production builds extract everything to
#     hashed files, at which point the operator can tighten this to remove
#     'unsafe-inline'. Tracked in CLAUDE.md §P2 polish.
#   * `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` — same reasoning; Tailwind via CDN
#     ships inline `<style>`. Production PostCSS extraction lets this tighten.
#   * `img-src 'self' data:` — admits inline data: URIs (favicon, file
#     previews).
#   * `connect-src 'self'`   — the SPA talks to the same origin. If a
#     deployment fronts the API on a different host, this list must
#     widen — but for the demo single-origin (vite proxy → backend)
#     'self' is sufficient.
#   * `font-src 'self' data:` — Tailwind / Inter fonts via data:.
#   * `object-src 'none'`    — refuses Flash / Java embeds (legacy attack
#     surface; we have no use case).
#   * `frame-ancestors 'none'` — clickjacking-proof, paired with the
#     X-Frame-Options: DENY header for older browsers.
#   * `base-uri 'self'`      — refuses an injected `<base>` tag from
#     redirecting relative URLs to a hostile origin.
#   * `form-action 'self'`   — refuses an injected `<form action="...">`
#     posting to a hostile origin (we have no cross-origin forms).
#
# Permissions-Policy zeroes out geolocation / camera / mic / payment — none
# of which the patent-prosecution UX needs. If a future feature legitimately
# wants one of these, narrow the deny list (and document why).
#
# HSTS: 1-year max-age + includeSubDomains. We omit `preload` because that
# is an irrevocable browser-list commitment; opt in only when the
# deployment is unquestionably stable on https.

        #       a miss that should have been a hit (NFKC + dictionary
        #       normalise away in the redaction step);

        #       bump (new PII rule, tenant dictionary refresh) automatically

      - Redaction: NOT applied here. The extracted text is returned to the
        attorney; redaction happens at /v1/oa/analyze time as before.
      - Audit: writes a row recording file size + page count + ocr count +

        the audit row is written even on error paths via the try/finally

    """Assemble + return the final draft — ONLY after attorney sign-off (Q16).

    Hard export gate (Q16 decision): unless ``attorney_signoff`` is exactly
    ``True`` we refuse with 409 and produce NO document. The attorney ticking
    "我已逐項確認" in the DraftEditor is what flips that flag; an un-ticked
    checkbox means the request is an auditable refused-export attempt, not an
    export.

    On success the gateway:
      1. Re-checks the case ACL on ``body.case_id`` (C-3 belt-and-braces — the
         dependency only saw the X-Case-Id header, not the JSON body).
      2. Assembles the document from the ACCEPTED provenance segments.
      3. Records EXACTLY ONE audit row capturing WHO signed off, the case, the
         provenance SUMMARY (counts of ai_generated / attorney_edited /
         attorney_added — the responsibility boundary), signoff=True, and the
         SHA-256 of the assembled document. It deliberately stores NO raw draft
         text — only counts + the content hash (CLAUDE.md §9).

    Feedback capture (Q16): the ``attorney_edited`` + ``attorney_added`` counts
    in the audit row ARE the feedback signal. We don't run a training pipeline
    here — we just ensure the edit deltas are durably captured in the audit
    trail so a future loop can mine high-edit exports to improve the AI draft.

    The whole flow runs inside a try/finally so an audit row is written even on
    the refusal path and even when assembly throws (invariant #4, CLAUDE.md §4).
    The refused-export attempt is itself an auditable event (signoff=False).
